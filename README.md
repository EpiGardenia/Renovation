## IOS, SwiftUI Technical Details
This is portfolio app, so here are details of different skills applied. 

### Localization
Localizable.strings: English (sysetm), Swedish
Localizable.stringsdict: Localize the variable format in sentence ( e.g. 1 apple, 2 apples)
Use `genstrings -SwiftUI *.swift -s localize -o .`  with string extension to internationalize all strings
Use tablename to category localization strings to be more maintainable
